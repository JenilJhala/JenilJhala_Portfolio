## About Me

Hello! I'm **Jenil Jhala**, an aspiring **Software Engineer** with a solid foundation in full-stack development, game development, and database management. I am passionate about building scalable and efficient systems. I specialize in programming languages such as **C#, Python, Java**, and **JavaScript**, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies.

I am currently pursuing a **Diploma in Computer Programming** from **Conestoga College** and actively working on projects to enhance my skills and contribute to real-world solutions.

## Projects

### Capstone Project: Small Used Car Dealership Management System

- **Technologies Used**: **.NET Core**, **MySQL**, **C#**, **Entity Framework**
- **Description**: This project involves creating a database-driven system to manage car inventory, customer details, and sales transactions for a small used car dealership. 
  - **Features**:
    - Inventory management: Add, update, and delete car inventory records.
    - Customer management: Track customer details, sales history, and payments.
    - Reporting: Generate reports on sales, inventory, and customer activity.
  - **Role**: I focused on **backend development**, utilizing **.NET Core** and **MySQL** for database management. My responsibilities included designing and implementing the database schema, writing SQL queries, and developing business logic.

### Bowling Game

- **Technologies Used**: **MonoGame**, **C#**
- **Description**: This is a two-level bowling game developed using **MonoGame**. The player must time their strike to hit a moving ball and knock down pins.
  - **Features**:
    - **Level 1**: Simple bowling mechanics where the player times the strike to knock down pins.
    - **Level 2**: Increased difficulty with faster ball speed and unpredictable wind resistance on the rail.
  - **Role**: I worked on the **backend development**, implementing the game logic and functionality. I focused on the timing and physics of the ball, as well as animations for the pins. My groupmates helped with the **front-end design** and user interface.
